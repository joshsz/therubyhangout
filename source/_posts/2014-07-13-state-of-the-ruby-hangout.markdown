### Looking Back

The Ruby Hangout has been a lot of fun. I've enjoyed talking to
lots of great notable people and learning about all kinds of awesome
projects.

My own life has been getting busier and busier. I'm the CTO of a growing
startup, and my priorities have shifted sufficiently so that staying on
top of a monthly meeting has gotten beyond me. *Ultimately I think the
future holds lots of great things for the Ruby Hangout but perhaps not
as a monthly event.*

### Looking outside

The Ruby Hangout has been a wonderful vehicle to meet interesting people and
share that with you. I'd love to talk to lots more people about Ruby
and where we're going with it. There are other interesting things
going on out there in the world of development too though.

I started the [DC Polyglot Programming Meetup] and I've been really
excited to learn about new things across the industry. I think
cross-pollination is the only way to get the best ideas all the time,
otherwise you get a serious echo-chamber.

The [Ruby Rogues] had an [interesting talk with Dave Thomas] recently.
He said you should always be challenging your own status quo. He
recommended for example to try programming without TDD. I love TDD, but
when I write other languages I don't use it as much. It led me to wonder
what's really important---is the value in writing the tests or is the
value in the confidence in our code that we get out of it? It's just one
example but it's interesting, and it's the kind of thinking I've opened
myself to by considering how other people get things done.

### The Future

*The Ruby Hangout will continue, just more sporadically.* Subscribe to
[our Google Plus page] and you'll always get alerts when we have a
hangout, or follow us on twitter at [@rubyhangout].

And always check out our past hangouts in the sidebar, they're all lots
of fun!
