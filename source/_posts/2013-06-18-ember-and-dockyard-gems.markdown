As children we see the world with a sense of wonder that comes about from a sense of newness with the world. This month [Brian Cardarella] brought back that sense of wonder and excitement as he spoke to us about [Dockyard]'s gems, [Ember.js] and organizing Boston's upcoming Ruby conference [Wicked Good Ruby Conf].

Brian discussed the following gems:

* [ClientSideValidations] - Like the name suggests. Check Dockyard's [github page] for the gems that they support.
* [ValidAttribute] - Validation matcher that easily plugs into your testing framework of choice.
* [Capybara-Email]: Dead simple way of testing your email.
* [Postgres_ext] - Adds support for missing PostgreSQL datatypes to ActiveRecord 3.2 and 4
* [Dismissible Helpers] - Renders a helper only if the website visitor hasn't dismissed it.
* [PartyFoul] - Alternative to airbrake that allows you to use github to track your errors.
* [ContextValidations] - Context validations for rails.

Brian also gave an excellent talk on the history of [Ember.js], the benefits of using it and how it is being used. For those considering using it, it was pointed out that [Discourse] is the current post child for Ember. Brian also provided some excellent resources for learning Ember such as the [Ember guides] as well as the [EmberCasts] and [Ember101] screencasts for video learning. This only scratches the surface of the talk, everything from forms to json to hateos was discussed with a great quote from Yehuda thrown in there too. It is definitely worth watching.

Next month we have [Aaron Patterson] who is on both the Ruby and Rails core team and sure to amaze us.
