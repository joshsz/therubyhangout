Before we have our first meetup next week, I wanted to take a minute to
let you know what the format will be like, and also some plans I have
for future hangouts.

<small>**TL;DR**: [G+ hangout broadcast to YouTube][1], small G+
hangouts after for beers and chat, G+ comments to keep the conversation
going.</small>

### Enabling Technology: Google +

Standard Google+ Hangouts allow up to 10 people to hangout, but recently
Google has added [broadcast capabilities via YouTube][1] so any number
of people can watch the hangout live. We plan for the "main" hangout to
have our hosts, presenters, and a few moderators / special guests. The
rest of the community will be engaged on YouTube. Our moderators will be
promoting comments from YouTube live into the hangout's text chat, where
hosts or guests can read them and bring them up to our presenters. Our
goal is to make everyone feel like they're part of the conversation.

### Our First Meetup

Keeping that in mind, our format will be (for the first meetup at
least), an introduction, announcements, two presentations each followed
by questions, and then breaking out into smaller hangouts to bring
the community together.

### Building a Real Community

One of the things I love most about my local meetups is the time after
the presentations when I can hang out, drink a beer, and get to know the
other people in my community. We want to have that same feeling at The
Ruby Hangout, so we're going to have break-out "drink-up" sessions after
the presentations. These G+ Hangouts will be each created by one of the
hosts, presenters, moderators, or special guests who were in the
original hangout. These will be informal sessions for people to get to
know each other and chat about Ruby or other things of interest to
community members. The organizers will try and keep a list of active
hangouts so people can move around, getting to know as many people as
they like.

### Afterward

The recording of the hangout will be available on YouTube for anyone to
watch. One of the problems we're forseeing is that we'll be recording at
7pm Eastern time, but that's not necessarily convenient for people
around the world. We're considering ways to continue the conversation
with both our presenters and the community at large and make people
across the world feel welcome. Some ideas we're thinking about are
collecting comments and forwarding them to our presenters up to 24 hours
after the meetup, or simply asking our presenters to respond to comments
on the meetup in our Google+ stream. We could really use more ideas
around this, what are your thoughts?

### The Future

We're looking for presenters and great presentations. The core of our
community is knowledge sharing, so if you have anything you'd like to
share, please [let us know][2]. 

One idea we've had is to have short "ruby newbie" intro presentations.
Each would be 5 - 10 minutes and would help introduce ruby and related
technologies to newcomers. Think it's a good or bad idea? Let us know in
the comments!
