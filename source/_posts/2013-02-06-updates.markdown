Tonight's (5th!) hangout will be with [Avdi Grimm][1], join us at 7pm
Eastern for a wide mass-pairing session about rogue tapas!

I've been pretty bad about updating the website, but we're still going
strong! For easy access, here are all our hangouts to date:

[Hangout 1: Chad Fowler and Evan Light][2]
[Hangout 2: Jeff Casimir][3]
[Hangout 3: Charles Nutter][4]
[Hangout 4: Teaching Kids Ruby Rountable][5] with [Alberto Morales][6], [Bill Davenport][7], [Rich Kilmer][8], and [Ron Evans][9]

We've moved into more of a one-person-at-a-time format, and I think
it's working well. We'd love to hear your thoughts!
