With the heat and humidity we've been having here on the East coast you
would think that summer is already here. Don't despair, think of this
weather as an opportunity to stay inside where it is air conditioned and
participate in some of the upcoming Ruby Hangouts!

Last month we were extremely fortunate to have with us [John Athayde],
of [The Rails View] fame. John gave an exremely useful talk on
organizing the view layer of Rails. Some of the topics he touched on
included dealing with legacy code, things you should avoid doing, the
amazing and awesome power of SASS/SCSS, the usefulness of presenters and
useful ways of organizing and re-using your code through partials.

After his talk John answered numerous audience questions ranging from
things to do when you come on to an ugly project that has 1000 line view
files, the good and bad of twitter bootstrap to what to do when you are
a developer and you don't have access to a designer. It is definitely
worth watching the whole talk [here].

Next month we have [Brian Cardarella] who will be talking about some of
the amazing gems that his company, [Dockyard], maintains as well as
[Ember.js].
