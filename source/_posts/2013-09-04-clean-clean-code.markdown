[Jim Gay] talked about cleaning up and making your code more understandable through DCI (Data, Contect and Interaction.) Jim discussed delegation, extending classes and gave us one of the best programming quotes we've ever heard. 'Your brain is the first compiler, you should optimize for that.' Jim also discussed how DCI makes testing, thinking about the project and bringing new people on to the project much much easier.

You can [view the hangout on youtube] and if you want to hear Jim say his fantastic quote, you can see [it here].

Jim also offered the watchers of the podcast a discount if you want to read more about it. Just head over to the [clean ruby] website and use the code `HANGOUT`.
